This python module implements an (ORM) object relational mapping 
to an sqlite database containing the annotation information from 
the XML files provided by the LIDC dataset. The purpose of this 
module is to make for easier data querying and to include 
functional aspects of the data models in addition to pure 
attribute information, e.g., computing nodule centroids from 
contour attribtues.

The ORM is implemented using sqlalchemy. There are three data models:

Scan, Annotation, and Contour

The relationships are "one to many" for each model going left 
to right, i.e., scans have many annotations and annotations 
have many contours.

For more information, see the model classes themselves.
